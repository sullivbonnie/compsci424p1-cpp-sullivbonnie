# UWW COMPSCI 424 Program 1 C++ template

## Your notes for me

*If you have notes or messages for me, please put them here so I can see them.*

## About this repository and autograding
 
Use this template for Operating Systems Program 1 in C++.

The included files use a (mostly) typical C++ file structure for a program like this. Feel free to change, add, divide, combine, or delete files; add or combine classes; create more methods; modify the existing methods; and more. Providing correct functionality is more important than having a specific program structure.

The GitHub Classroom autograder will compile and run your code on a Linux virtual machine using the GNU C++ compiler with the following commands.
```
g++ -std=c++17 -o cs424p1 *.cpp *.cc *.C
./cs424p1
```

This means that you can use all C++ features that are supported by the C++17 standard plus amendments. If you develop on **washington.uww.edu**, suggested compiler commands are `gcc-5` (C) or `g++-5` (C++).

If you are encountering problems getting your code to pass tests when you push to GitHub Classroom, please [email me](osterz@uww.edu) with a description of what's happening. I will look at your repository on GitHub to try to help you debug.

## Advice for C++ programmers

This advice is also posted on the Program 1 page on Canvas. Updates, if any, will be posted there.

* Instead of classes, you could use 2 separate functions, then use the main function/method to run the tests and evaluate running times for both versions. You may define additional functions as needed.
* The `clock` function, provided by `#include <ctime>` (C++) or `#include <time.h>` (C), gives you a current time measurement as the number of "clock ticks" since a previous time. For an example of timing part of a C++ program, see: [clock - C++ Reference](http://cplusplus.com/reference/ctime/clock/). The example code works in essentially the same way in C.
* C++ programmers may use the `forward_list` or `list` class template that is defined in the C++11 standard to implement your linked lists.
  - If you want to use a `forward_list` or `list` object in your program, you will need to `#include <forward_list>` or `#include <list>`.
  - If the `g++` compiler complains about these names not being defined, try adding the `-std=c++14` or `-std=c++17` option to your compile command.
  - More info about these class templates: [forward_list - C++ Reference](http://cplusplus.com/reference/forward_list/forward_list/), [list - C++ Reference](http://cplusplus.com/reference/list/list/).
  - You can also use your own linked list implementation if you prefer that.
